Description: Ruby implementation of the Coveralls API
 Coveralls is a web service to help you track your code coverage over
 time, and ensure that all your new code is fully covered.
 .
 Coveralls automatically collects your code coverage data, uploads it
 to their servers and gives you a nice interface to dig into it.
 .
 Any type of Ruby project or test framework supported by SimpleCov is
 supported by the Coveralls gem. This includes all your favorites, like
 RSpec, Cucumber, and Test::Unit.
 .
 This package provides a Ruby gem to interact with Coveralls API.
