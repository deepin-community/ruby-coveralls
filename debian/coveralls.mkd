coveralls(1) -- Coveralls API client utility
============================================

## SYNOPSIS

__coveralls__ _sub-command_

## DESCRIPTION

Coveralls is a command-line utility to interact with Coveralls web service
to help you track your code coverage over time, and ensure that all your
new code is fully covered.

Coveralls automatically collects your code coverage data, uploads it
to their servers and gives you a nice interface to dig into it.

Any type of Ruby project or test framework supported by SimpleCov is
supported by the Coveralls gem. This includes all your favorites, like
RSpec, Cucumber, and Test::Unit.

## SUB-COMMANDS

  * `help` COMMAND:
    Describe available commands or one specific command.
  * `last`:
    View the last build for this repository on Coveralls.
  * `open`:
    View this repository on Coveralls.
  * `push`:
    Runs your test suite and pushes the coverage results to Coveralls.
  * `report`:
    Runs your test suite locally and displays coverage statistics.
  * `service`:
    View this repository on your CI service's website.
  * `version`:
    See version.

## CONFIGURATION

Coveralls for Ruby uses an optional `.coveralls.yml` file at the root
level of your repository to configure options.

The option `repo_token` (found on your repository's page on Coveralls)
is used to specify which project on Coveralls your project maps to.
This is only needed for repos not using a CI and should be kept
secret -- anyone could use it to submit coverage data on your repo's
behalf. This shouldn't be a concern for private repos, however.

Another important option is `service_name` which allows you to specify
where Coveralls should look to find additional information about your
builds. This can be any string, but using travis-ci or travis-pro will
allow Coveralls to fetch branch data, comment on pull requests, and more.
